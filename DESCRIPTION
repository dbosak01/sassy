Description: A meta-package that aims to make 'R' easier for everyone, 
    especially programmers who have a background in 'SASÂ®' software.
    This set of packages brings many useful concepts to 'R', including
    data libraries, data dictionaries, formats 
    and format catalogs, a data step, and a traceable log.  The 'flagship'
    package is a reporting package that can output in text, rich text, 'PDF' and 
    'HTML' file formats.
