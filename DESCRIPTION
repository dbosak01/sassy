Description: A meta-package that aims to make 'R' easier for 'SAS®' programmers.
    This set of packages brings many familiar concepts to 'R', including
    data libraries, data dictionaries, formats 
    and format catalogs, a data step, and a traceable log.  The 'flagship'
    package is a reporting package that can output in text, rich text, and 
    'PDF' file formats.
